# Netflix Clone

## Project Overview

This project is a simple clone of the Netflix website created using HTML and CSS. It replicates the visual layout and design elements of Netflix's homepage to showcase front-end web development skills.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the layout adjusts gracefully to different screen sizes (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Header Section**: Includes Netflix logo, navigation links, and a sign-in button.
- **Hero Section**: Features a large banner with a title, subtitle, and call-to-action buttons.
- **Content Rows**: Displays movie and TV show thumbnails organized into horizontal carousels.
- **Footer Section**: Contains links to support pages, terms and conditions, and contact information.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure and semantic markup of the website.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout, including Flexbox and Grid for alignment.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-link]
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd netflix-clone
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.

## File Structure

```
netflix-clone/
│
├── index.html       # Main HTML file
├── style.css        # CSS file for styling
└── assets/          # Folder containing images and other static assets
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add interactivity using JavaScript (e.g., carousel scrolling, sign-in modal).
- Integrate real movie/TV show data using APIs.
- Improve accessibility by adding ARIA roles and proper alt attributes.
